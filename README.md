## **🟦What is UI/UX?**


-   " **User Interface (UI) design** is the process of transforming wireframes into a polished graphical user interface ". a UI designer’s job begins where a UX designer’s job ends—at the prototyping stage. They take the wireframes and add visual design to make them more usable, aesthetically appealing, and optimized for different screen sizes.

-   " **User Experience (UX) design** is about understanding the overall journey of your users and turning it into a product. The role of a user experience designer is to understand the customer journey. That means understanding the target audience, interviewing customers, defining user flows, and conducting user testing.
